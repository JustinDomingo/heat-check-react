# Heat-Check Weather App (React Version)

Heat Check is a very simple React application that uses the useState and useEffect React hooks and a public API.Once the initial webpage is loaded, a user can use the input field to search for weather data of any city in the world. The weather data includes the city, temperature, weather, and matching icons. When the form is submitted, an axios get request is sent to an open API to get the relevant data.
